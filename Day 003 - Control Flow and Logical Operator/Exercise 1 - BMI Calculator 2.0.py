Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

bmi = weight (kg) / height square (m sq)

Example Input

weight = 80
height = 1.75

Example Output

80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
26

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.

print("Your BMI is:",bmi)

if bmi < 18.50:
    print("You are underweight")
