Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

bmi = weight (kg) / height square (m sq)

Example Input

weight = 80
height = 1.75

Example Output

80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
26

weight = int(input("Enter your weight: "))
